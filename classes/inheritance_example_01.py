# Below we have a base class called Clothing. Together, letâ€™s create a second class, called Shirt, that inherits methods from the Clothing class.

class Clothing:
  material = ""
  def __init__(self,name):
    self.name = name
  def checkmaterial(self):
	  print("This {} is made of {}".format(self.name,self.material))
			
class Shirt(Clothing):
  material="Cotton"

polo = Shirt("Polo")
polo.checkmaterial()
